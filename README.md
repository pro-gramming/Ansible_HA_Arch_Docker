# ansible_testing_env
For learning ansible

# For worker1
user - remote_user
hostname - worker1

# For worker2
user - remote_user
hostname - worker2

# Run script
Run the script after providing it with sufficient permissions.

Like: chmod 644 ansible_scipt.sh

Now run script as: ./ansible_script.sh

# Note:
You need to manually run the docker-compose down after finishing the task.

That facility will also be provided after a bit of time.

Thanks! Have a nice day.
